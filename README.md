# FeChallenge

This project is supposed to be in React; however, after the permission of Mr. Anuraag, I built in using the latest version of Angular.

Due to time limit, the cart feature wasn't implemented yet.

It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Improvements to be done
Sass variables
